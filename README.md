## DESCRIPTION

RDF::RDFXML is an [RDF/XML][RDF/XML] reader/writer for [Ruby][] using the [RDF.rb][RDF.rb] library suite.

## FEATURES
RDF::RDFXML parses [RDF/XML][] into statements or triples and serializes triples, statements or graphs. It also serializes graphs to [RDF/XML][].

Fully compliant [RDF/XML][] parser and serializer.

Install with `gem install rdf-rdfxml`

* 100% free and unencumbered [public domain](https://unlicense.org/) software.
* Implements a complete parser for [RDF/XML][].
* Compatible with Ruby >= 2.4.

## Usage:
Instantiate a parser and parse source, specifying type and base-URL

    RDF::RDFXML::Reader.open("./etc/doap.xml") do |reader|
      reader.each_statement do |statement|
        puts statement.inspect
      end
    end

Define `xml:base` and `xmlns` definitions, and use for serialization using `:base_uri` an `:prefixes` options.

Canonicalize and validate using `:canonicalize` and `:validate` options.

Write a graph to a file:

    RDF::RDFXML::Writer.open("etc/test.ttl") do |writer|
       writer << graph
    end

## Contributing
This repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.

* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec`, `VERSION` or `AUTHORS` files. If you need to
  change them, do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding
  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you,
  which you will be asked to agree to on the first commit to a repo within the organization.
  Note that the agreement applies to all repos in the [Ruby RDF](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/) organization.
